						<p>There has been noticeable progress in the group project, we defined a structure and completed the group discussion activity. 
							We also started with the background research and literature review, to understand the ISS better. Our system will be in charge of checking some of the environment parameters of the spacecraft. We defined 3 system capabilities: </p>
						<ul style="margin-top: 2%;">
							<li>Cabin oxygen checks </li>
							<li>Cabin temperature checks</li>
							<li>Safe cabin pressure level check</li>
						</ul>
						<p>I also completed my summary post in broken access control, where I implemented some of the feedback my tutors and peers gave me. I am starting to feel the workload on my shoulders and will be putting in as many hours as possible. 
							I particularly enjoyed the producer-consumer activity, using the semaphore architecture to process requests parallelly in the system. Moreover will try achieving something like this it in the ISS design implementation. </p>

                        <button class="button primary" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 2%;" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown1')">Team discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language?</button>
                        <div style="width: 100%" id="dropdown1" class="dropdown-content">
							<p><b>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</b></p>
							<p>Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) states that programming languages are inherently insecure as most of them are underpinned on old tools and techniques. This gives way to new approaches to produce intrinsically safe languages. Nevertheless, we still need to take care of protecting our software with the currently available programming tools.</p>
							<p>Pillai (2017) defines secure coding as the practices that inherently safeguard programs from malicious attacks. Furthermore, security requirements should be identified in the early stages of development of the program, and he identifies the practices to do so. These are the different practices in broad terms:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Define software architecture to protect assets and identify components.</li>
								<li>Review implementation and identify threats.</li>
								<li>Risk mitigation and testing.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) list the following categories of vulnerabilities that can be mitigated with secure software design:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Buffer Errors</li>
								<li>Injection Errors</li>
								<li>Information Leak Errors</li>
							</ul>
							<p>On the other hand, Pillai (2017) emphasizes on a few other vulnerabilities that must be taken care of, apart from the ones Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) defined: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Improper access control</li>
								<li>Unvalidated input</li>
								<li>Cryptography</li>
								<li>Serialization/deserialization of code and data objects</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Let’s explore them with their proposed mitigations in more detail:</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Buffer Errors</p>
							<p>Buffer overflow allows attackers to take control of systems by writing off-buffer bounds manually crafted code, or simply clogging your program into a deadlock with mathematical operations. </p>
							<p>To mitigate it, Pillai (2017) uses exception handlers to show a custom error message. On the other hand, Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) defines managed memory, such as garbage collection very effective as well as borrowing objects so they are self-destroyed when out of scope. More complex but effective methods are presented by Chen et al., (2013), like pointer encryption and address randomization. However there’s a drawback to these, as the application will be immediately terminated if overflow detected.</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Injection Errors</p>
							<p>Injection errors, or injection attacks exploit unvalidated input vulnerabilities (Pillai, 2017). Using this attack, malicious actors can insert arbitrary code instead of legitimate input. According to Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) examples of this attack are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>SQL injections – if a website is susceptible to this attack, attackers can write SQL code instead of genuine information into an input field (e.g. a login page username field).</li>
								<li>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) – this attack involves injecting harmful code into a trustworthy website compromising data.</li>
								<li>Shell Execution Exploits, also known as command injection – attacker exploits vulnerable applications to run system level commands (Zhong, N.D.)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In addition to these attacks, Pillai (2017) also lists below vulnerability:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Server-Side Template Injections – server-side templates of web frameworks are used to execute malicious code.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>To mitigate the SQL injection and XSS attacks Pillai (2017) lists the following strategies amongst the top 10:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Validate inputs – ensure that data inserted by the user matches the data type of the input field.</li>
								<li>Principle of least privilege – only necessary permissions should be assigned to users to carry out their work.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Information Leak Errors</p>
							<p>Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) define it as the release of information to an untrusted environment. Similarly, open access to files, folders, and databases can lead to data breaches if not properly restricted to authorized users. Race conditions, caused by simultaneous access to resources without synchronization, can allow attackers to insert malicious code or disrupt operations. System clock drifts can introduce security flaws, such as SSL certificate validation errors, which can be exploited by timing attacks.</p>
							<p>To mitigate these, Pillai (2017) suggests implementing proper access controls, synchronization mechanisms, and time synchronization protocols. Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) take the mitigation beyond program boundaries and explain that faceted values provide a strong solution as they also back databases using policies and data tagging for different security data.</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Improper access control</p>
							<p>This vulnerability allows attackers to gain access to sensitive data, or even the whole system. Incorrectly implemented access control mechanisms can expose routes and workflows to an attacker, which can in turn be utilised to expose sensitive data (Pillai, 2017).</p>
							<p>To mitigate this vulnerability, Pillai (2017) suggests that applications should have clearly defined roles and privileges for each type of users, such as administrators, superusers, standard users, etc.</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Unvalidated input</p>
							<p>It is extremely important to clean the input as malicious code can be inserted into the input to gain access to unauthorised data. 
								There are several mitigation methods, but a very sensible one for example, using newer and safer string formatting than just using unsafe %s interpolation (Pillai, 2017).
							</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Cryptography</p>
							<p>It is a big field in security with many branches and applications. It introduces concepts such as hashing, secure protocols (HTTPS), strong asymmetric key encryption and server and computer encryption (SSL and GPG respectively). </p>
							<p>Cryptography can be difficult to bypass if well implemented, but to ensure the maximum protection, always look at hashes rather than comparing memory allocation. These can be implemented in several rounds, for extra security (Passlib is presented as a good ciphering tool in Python) according to (Pillai, 2017).</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Serialization/deserialization of code and data objects</p>
							<p>Quite trivial, when problems start to arise by not using the latest library versions and Python builds.</p>
							<p>Python versions have improved security aspects like trying to trick the output by entering a certain input, exposing hard-coded data. Python 2.x would expose some hard-coded data easily when no error exceptions are handled, but the same issues do not apply to Python 3.x (Pillai, 2017).</p>
							<p><b>Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</b></p>
							<p>Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) argue that not a single major programming language today, including Python, can be regarded as fool proof from any attacks. In support of this, Pillai (2017) discusses some threats Python is susceptible to:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Phishers can disclose unprotected global variables and password when reading inputs from the console.</li>
								<li>Attackers can take advantage of the ‘eval’ function to deliberately fail interpreters and take the reins over them.</li>
								<li>Interception of software during buffer overflow exceptions.</li>
								<li>Code can be carried out without monitoring in the ‘pickle’ module.</li>
								<li>Unauthorised access is accepted once hackers get inside the system during Server Side Template Injection (SSTI).</li>
								<li>Applications cannot function accordingly due to Denial of Service (DOS), when systems are intentionally overloaded.</li>
								<li>Hostile scripts can be inserted in systems during Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to take command of programs.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>However, there are strategies that can be implemented in order to alleviate vulnerabilities in Python. These include better handling of classified information such as passwords, keeping abreast of the latest trends in cyber security, and regularly applying security updates (Pillai, 2017). 
								Therefore, despite not being a fully secure language, developers can follow these recommendations to lessen threats and weaknesses in Python.</p>
							<p><b>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</b></p>
							<p>Operating systems (OS) serve as the layer between computer hardware and software. Mwiinga (2023) suggests that in order to fulfill this role, an OS must include, among others, the following functions:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Process management.</li>
								<li>Memory management.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are many considerations to be made when selecting a programming language to develop these functions, but we will focus here on performance and security and discuss whether the attributes of the Python programming language make it more suitable for such tasks than the C programming language.</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Performance</p>
							<p>A modern OS such as Microsoft Windows 10 can be expected to run hundreds of processes concurrently. It is essential therefore that each process runs as efficiently as possible. This is one area in which the C language has a clear advantage given that it is a compiled language. In contrast, Python is an interpreted language and requires extra time to be converted into machine code by the interpreter (Zehra et al, 2020). 
								As such, the difference in performance can be considerable. Zehra et al show that when performing a memory insertion algorithm, the average time taken for a program written in C++ was 0.006ms versus 0.028ms for the Python program – a greater than fourfold increase in execution time.</p>
							<p>Memory management is another area in which compiled languages such as C have a clear advantage. In Python, as a dynamically typed language, memory management is handled at runtime and therefore does not offer the programmer the ability to finely tune memory usage. As a result, similar processes occupy considerably larger amounts of memory. This was demonstrated by Zehra et al who showed that a memory sorting algorithm written in C++ used 5.4KB versus 11.7KB for Python – a more than twofold increase. 
								This would be particularly concerning for an OS considering the number of concurrent processes in memory. If we were to assume the above example was typical, then an OS written in Python would require twice the RAM of an OS written in C.</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Security</p>
							<p>Security threats targeting the Windows OS are numerous thanks to the ubiquity of the OS, requiring Microsoft to release frequent security updates. As such, when developing an OS, it is essential that the language used in its development is as secure as possible. 
								Cifuentes and Bierman (2019) break down security threats into three categories: buffer errors, injection errors and information leak errors and later show that no mainstream programming language can protect against all three categories. However buffer errors occur as a result of manual management of memory pointers, suggesting that Python, having automated memory management, may not be as susceptible to this.</p>
							<p class="subsection_paragraph">Conclusion</p>
							<p>As we have seen, neither C nor Python can be regarded as a fully secure programming language, but there does not appear to be a reason to avoid Python from a security perspective. The difference in performance and memory management however suggests that Python would not be suitable as a language in which to develop an OS, therefore the suggestion that Python would be better than C for this task cannot be supported.</p>

								<figcaption>Fig. 1: Buffer overflow script ran in terminal</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p style="margin-top: 3%;">The output is “zsh: abort”, and this one is a Z shell abortion command, encountered when there are syntax errors, command not found issues, interruptions and importantly, memory allocation errors.</p>
							<p>Apparently, when using the enriched prompts from the GNU C library (glibc), the prompt looks slightly different, and gives us more information. This is a buffer overflow protection mechanism in the GCC compiler via protection variables (canaries) that have known values. If the input, which is assigned to a canary corrupts it, the program will terminate. The output would look like:</p>

							<p><b>Buffer overflow in Python</b></p>
							<p>The proposed code was the following, and follows the same principle of storing more data into an object than the amount it can take:</p>
							<pre>
								<code>
buffer = [None] * 10
for i in range(0, 14)
	buffer[i] = 7						
print(buffer)	
								</code>
							</pre>
							<p>When running this piece of code, the program stops and flags the index out of range error. We are trying to save 14 values into a list with only 10 available places. See fig. 2:</p>

						<button class="button primary" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 2%;" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown3')">Activity: The producer-consumer mechanism</button>
						<div style="width: 100%" id="dropdown3" class="dropdown-content">
							<p>The producer-consumer problem simulates a semaphore that regulates the interaction between a producer and a consumer. In the provided code, several consumers are created prior to the producer. These consumers will be taking product from the producer if and only if there's product available in the producer's queue. This producer feeds several consumers, each represented with a thread. 
								The queue architechture from the consumer ensures that only 1 item is removed at once, it will not allow more to avoid task repetition and overriding tasks. After taking the produce, the consumer processes the item and marks it as done. When the producer runs out of produce, the consumer threads are shut down and the main program thread exited. This is possible by using daemon threads, which will terminate as soon as the main one does. Here's the semaphore architecture:</p>
							<figure class="center">
								<img src="images/semaphore.jpeg" alt="Semaphore">
								<figcaption>Fig. 3: Semaphore architecture, from Shene (2014)</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p style="margin-top: 3%;">And here the proposed code:</p>
							<pre>
								<code>
from threading import Thread
from queue import Queue
	
q = Queue()
final_results = []
	
def producer():
	for i in range(100):
		q.put(i)
		
	
def consumer():
	while True:
		number = q.get()
		result = (number, number**2)
		final_results.append(result)
		q.task_done()
	
	
for i in range(5):
	t = Thread(target=consumer)
	t.daemon = True
	t.start()
	
producer()
	
q.join()
	
print (final_results)
								</code>
							</pre>
							<p>In this code, if the producer was to make something different to an integer or float, the program will not work as intended, as you cannot take the power of a string. I introduced a solution to the code, that by filtering the produce at the producer level, the consumers will be guaranteed the right input is fed to them. Then the consumers patiently wait for the filtered input and gather it from the producer's queue. Here is my proposed solution:</p>
							<pre>
								<code>
import time
from threading import Thread
from queue import Queue

q = Queue()

entry = ["r", "a", "1", "0", "n", "g"]


def producer():
    for i in entry:
	# Note the use of the try except block within the for loop, 
	# so it's checked every time input (at this stage valid and invalid mixed) is produced
        try:
            print(f"List item {i} produced\n")
            if float(i) or float(i) == False:
                q.put(float(i))
        except ValueError:
            print("Input must be numerical")


def consumer():
    while True:
        number = q.get()
		# Introducing a sleep of 1 second here, simulates the consumer processing time
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"Number {number} processed by consumer\n")
        result = (number, number ** 2)
        final_results.append(result)
        q.task_done()
        print(f"Task {number} done\n")


final_results = []

# Changed the number of threads to 2, to ensure every thread takes input with my proposed entry
for i in range(2):
    t = Thread(target=consumer)
    t.daemon = True
    t.start()

producer()

q.join()

print(final_results)
