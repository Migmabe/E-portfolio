						<h3 class="override">Short reflection</h3>
						<p>Things are starting to get more hectic, I am putting long hours into developing the app, the security capabilities were implemented both at server and API level. There will surely be some fine tuning of these, and so far I am finding myself involved into debugging the system and it is quite time consuming. 
							This is because the security ON capability will not only avoid the system being attacked by the denial of service, injection and brute force but also will implement encrypted communication between the server and the API.</p>
						<p>I am to figure out how to run the server and the main application (essentially CLI) simultaneously, as the server did not allow further input into the console if running on the main thread. I suppose this will need to be done using the threading module. I also want to implement the registration functionality on the login window. I intend to make a registration button pop up when a new user registration password Azerty00 is detected.</p>
						<p>My full focus is on delivering this application.</p>

							<p><b>Do you think this is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage? What are the pros and cons?</b></p>
							<p>Alneyadi, Sithirasenan and Muthukkumarasamy (2016), define data leakage as an unwanted disclosure of information. I think it goes without saying that data leakage is never a good sign of software robustness. When dealing with any kind of data, if not in a public domain, data must be protected, otherwise made public.</p>
							<p>They explain that conventional data protection mechanisms can be naïve to an ever-evolving data semantics field and proposed data leakage prevention systems (DLPSs), not to spend that much time defining and mitigating these entry points. Defi Susanti and Kayyis Fithri Ajhuri (2023) take a political approach to define the issues of regulating personal data leakage. These are transparency for conducting investigations or government cover ups, undermining social trust.</p>
							<p>On an article of the American Business Law Journal by Voss and Houser (2019), they explain how closely linked data leakage and GDPR are. The United States started regulating data disclosure as a human right (“right to be alone”). The article explains how enforcing good data protection practices can potentially pose an advantage for a business if the data is used accordingly. Aside from customer satisfaction and business opportunities, the Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (2020), also state that data protection will help hold accountability of individuals that use data fraudulently.</p>
							<p>On the Schmitz et al. (2016) article, they propose a new method to hide data with faceted values. These, change its form and content to hide sensitive data if the viewer credentials do not meet the required permissions. Faceting data is not a new concept, so they proposed a new strategy which ensures more effective protection against leaks.</p>
							<p style="margin-top: 4%;"><b>Create a basic outline design of how you would create such a system in Python. </b></p>
							<figure class="center" style="margin-bottom: 4%;">

                                <figcaption>Fig. 1: Faceted data simple workflow</figcaption>
                            </figure>
							<p>With Python, I thought of implementing a simple Object-Oriented approach to simulate a faceting environment. There will be a superclass called Value, and this one will have a public and private attribute. Then, a subclass will inherit these and implement other security capabilities like encryption on these raw formats. With a getter method, we can check if the request fulfills the permissions required to access the private facet, if not the public, generic version will be returned.</p>

"""This file will present a simple faceted architecture in a system. As mentioned, encryption will take place at
subclass level, and there will be a superclass with the public and private faceted values"""


class Value:

    def __init__(self, private, public):
        self.private = private
        self.public = public

    def encryption(self):
        # Assume some encryption algorithm here and return the encrypted data, can be private or public
        return encrypted_value

    def decryption(self, encrypted_value):
        # Same here, assume a decryption algorithm
        return decrypted_value


class UserRequest:

    def __init__(self, credentials):
        self.credentials = credentials
        self.value = Value("actualdata", "clutteredrandom")

    def return_data(self):
        # Assume data has already been encrypted
        if self.credentials == "admin":
            return self.value.decryption(encrypted_value="something")
        else:
            return self.value.decryption(self.value.public)

						<div style="width: 100%" id="dropdown2" class="dropdown-content">
							<p>For the seminar activity, when trying to find the article from S. Fiore et al. (2019), I could not locate the referenced paragraph, but will describe the system that I implemented for the ISS.</p>
							<p>The system has different capabilities that were implemented with a server client architecture. The server was deployed using flask, and the API functionality was resembled with a script that was designed using the requests module in Python. The API requests had 2 different security levels, with security ON or OFF. When security was active, the server expected the API to send an encrypted key. Otherwise, the request would not be processed. After the request was processed (CRUD operations allowed) responsive feedback will be sent to the API client and returned to the user via the command line interface (CLI).</p>
							<p>This architecture was rather effective against attacks when the security capability was on, as the designed API was the only gateway the server would understand hence let through.</p>
