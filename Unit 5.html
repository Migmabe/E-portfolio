						<h3 class="override">Short reflection</h3>
						<p>This week was rather intense, personally and professionally. I had to really manage my time well as I was away for the week, and did not have much time, so had to make use of every free minute.</p>
						<p>The design document is done with a final check to be done altogether with the group. I really enjoyed mapping the OWASP security risks with their MITRE codes and back to our application. I could effectively rank our application into level 2, this point was raised last week when Dr. People’s asked if the resources used to secure our system were proportional to the value thereof.</p>
						<p>I also explored the concept of Cyclomatic Complexity, and found it rather interesting, with complex programs having values that surpass the 1000 mark. More on this on the next section, but it is basically the amount of decision points on our code. These could be assertions, else statements, exceptions…</p>

                        <button class="button primary" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 2%; word-wrap: break-word;" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown1')">Research activity: Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today</button>
                        <div style="width: 100%" id="dropdown1" class="dropdown-content">
							<p>According to IBM (2018), Cyclomatic Complexity was created by Thomas McCabe to determine the stability and level of confidence in a program. It measures the number of independent paths in the program, often called as decision points. The deeper this goes and more branches it has, the more complex the program is said to be.</p>
							<p>With this introduction, let me gauge the accuracy and relevancy of Cyclomatic Complexity nowadays and whether it still remains valid to test code. Lenarduzzi, Kilamo and Janes (2023), did an empirical study with some background research, comparing Cyclomatic and Cognitive Complexity. The latter, relies on other fundamental laws and in theory is more adaptive than Cyclomatic. 
								This is because not every decision point should count the same in the complexity scale, as some points are too hard or too easy for humans to understand. Theory supports this with the results they obtained on the test, as Cognitive Complexity yielded more accurate results than Cyclomatic to categorise 12 Java classes with more than 200 students taking the survey.</p>
							<p>However, on the other hand, Wijendra and Hewagamage (2021) state that Cyclomatic and Cognitive complexity are not related or complementary to each other as the latter is based on statements beyond computability, like human knowledge which is quite subjective.</p>
							<p>The perfect combination of Cyclomatic and Cognitive is the approach developed in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) application in Waweru (2013). In broad terms, his research thesis removes the human knowledge from the Cognitive Complexity but adds different weighing to different components like nesting level, inheritance and control structure.</p>
							<p>Determining code complexity is essential in the development of software (Newcombe et al., 2015), as the higher the complexity, the higher the risk of costly human and machine errors. This is extremely relevant in the software industry, proof of that is the enhanced Amazon Web Services, Inc. (2020) complexity detection tool Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer.</p>
							<p>Specific to this module, assessing the complexity of our code will help me scan the proposed system, easing the risk mitigation stages. Furthermore, complexity will have a big impact on testing to adapt the checks and understand the output.</p>
							<p style="margin-top: 4%;"><b>Team thoughts</b></p>
							<p>Within my team, there are several opinions as to whether Cyclomatic Complexity still plays a role in industry. However, the resources found by my teammates that support this I found to be slightly outdated. Although some studies still consider this technique valid, there are others that say that despite being useful when developing applications it should not be fully relied upon. 
								This is also what my background research concluded, with a blended approach between Cyclomatic and Cognitive.</p>

							<p>The equivalence testing activity was rather abstract and a fun experiment. The exercise required me to record some results, ideas and to experiment with the provided equivalence code (Stack Overflow, 2016):</p>

								</code>
							</pre>
							<p><b>First thing I learned:</b></p>
							<p>After checking and following the code execution, I came accross the assert operator. This one raises an assertion error when yields false, so tests are not passed. This message can be personalized for instances using this simple formatting:</p>
							<pre style="margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%;">
								<code>
a = {1, 2, 3, 6}

b = 6

# Print a message
assert b in a, f"{b} is not in a"								
								</code>
							</pre>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 3%; margin-top: 0%;">This can be used in the testing suite, to check for program execution and very convenient for testing.</p>
							<p><b>Second thing I learned:</b></p>
							<p>I found that the equivalence enumeration function did not impact the output, as it does not do any of the printing or classification but just indexing with enumeration the past classes by the first function equivalence partition. This is the function:</p>
							<pre style="margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%;">

classes, partitions = equivalence_partition(iterable, relation)
ids = {}
for i, c in enumerate(classes):
	for o in c:
		ids[o] = i
return classes, partitions, ids
								</code>
							</pre>
							<p><b>Third thing I learned:</b></p>
							<p>Functions are what they call them first class objects, as they can be passed as arguments to other functions. However, functions, if not passed with the argument parenthesis are interpreted as objects (Duke.edu, 2024):</p>
							<pre style="margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%;">
								<code>
def function1(f):
    print(f"{f}")


def function2():
    function3 = lambda x: 3
    function1(function3("hello"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    function2()

###OUTPUT: 3###
								</code>
							</pre>
							<p>If we replaced function1function3("hello") by function1(function3) without the parenthesis, the output would be:</p>
							<p class="center">Output = &lt;function function2.&lt;locals&gt;.&lt;lambda&gt; at 0x10dcf8d60&gt;</p>
							<p><b>Fourth thing I learned</b></p>
							<p>I worked on the __next__ and __iterable__ methods for classes that want to be taken as for instance a group of objects and want to pass every object as if it was a list, without saving them in a list. This is how they are built:</p>
							<pre style="margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%;">
								<code>
class MyIterable:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0  # Initialize index to keep track of current position

    def __iter__(self):
        # Return an iterator object
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        # Check if the index is within bounds
        if self.index &lt; len(self.data):
            # Get the current element and increment the index
            element = self.data[self.index]
            self.index += 1
            return element
        else:
            # If index is out of bounds, raise StopIteration
            raise StopIteration()


# Create an instance of MyIterable
my_iterable = MyIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Iterate over my_iterable using a for loop
for item in my_iterable:
    print(item)
								</code>
							</pre>
							<p><b>Fifth and last thing I learned</b></p>
							<p>With everything I learned, this is my interpretation of the provided equivalence testing code:</p>
							<pre>
								<code>
class mrIteration:

def __init__(self, data):
	self.index = 0
	self.content = data

def __iter__(self):
	return self

def __next__(self):
	if self.index &lt; len(self.content):
		element = self.content[self.index]
		self.index += 1
		return element
	else:
		raise StopIteration

def __getitem__(self, item):
	return self.content[item]

def pop(self):
	self.content = self.content[0:len(self.content) - 1]
	return self.content


b = mrIteration([{1}, {2}, {3}])

c = {}

for _ in range(-2, 2):
if _ &lt; 0:
	c[_] = b[0]
elif 0 &lt;= _ &lt; 1:
	c[_] = b[1]
elif 1 &lt;= _ &lt; 3:
	c[_] = b[2]

print(c)								
								</code>
							</pre>
							<p>The output would be a dictionary of the filtered data, something similar to the output of the Stack Overflow (2016) equivalence code:</p>
							<p class="center">{-2: {1}, -1: {1}, 0: {2}, 1: {3}}</p>
